# 📒 Contact Book Web App

The Contact Book is a lightweight, user-friendly web application that allows users to **add**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** contacts. Built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app interacts with a cloud-based REST API hosted at `mysite.itvarsity.org` for all data operations.
